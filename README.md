# Intro-to-iOS

I want to learn how to build iOS apps and this repository is meant to be a workspace and a way of keeping me accountable for my journey. My hope is that this repository will be a great tool for others to follow the same learning path that will make me an iOS engineer. I want to try and build one small app for myself every week throughout the summer following the best practices and most modern technologies. The goal of this roadmap is to learn how to build SASS mobile apps, not necessarily video game apps.

Resources:

May 30 - June 5th:
- Following a beginner friendly tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aP-SQXTtWhY (2 hours)
Learnings: I was able to build an app with multiple screens, navigate between screens and load in some constant data from a json file. There were a lot of things like decoding data from the app bundle that seemed strange but Paul is a great teacher and I plan on using more of his resources. Although this tutorial is very introductory, it's a great starting point regardless of your programming background. Paul explains concepts that were familiar to me in the context of iOS's environment. I found that adding comments to the parts of the tutorial that were somewhat complex helps me understand things in my own language/though process.

Rating: 10/10
Time commitment about 4 hours if you take a break in between.

Next Step: Now that I know some of the basics, I am going to work on building a more custom UI and exploring the modifiers. I want to learn how to take in user data and perform certain operations on their data.
