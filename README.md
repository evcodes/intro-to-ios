# Intro-to-iOS

## I want to learn how to build iOS apps and this repository is meant to be a workspace and a way of keeping me accountable for my journey. My hope is that this repository will be a great tool for others to follow the same learning path that will make me an iOS engineer. I want to try and build one small app for myself every week throughout the summer following the best practices and most modern technologies. The goal of this roadmap is to learn how to build SASS mobile apps, not necessarily video game apps.
